          <p class="text-[#366951] leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Founded in 2020 in Purdy, WA, Black Cat Barber began with a simple vision: to create an elevated barbershop experience where high-quality services meet meaningful connections.
          </p>
          <p class="text-[#366951] leading-relaxed mb-4">
            In 2023, we relocated to our current home in Gig Harbor, bringing our unique blend of traditional craftsmanship and modern techniques to the community. As a family-owned barbershop collective, we're more than just a place to get a haircut—we're a gathering space for creativity, conversation, and connection.
